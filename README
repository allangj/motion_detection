This project is about a motion detection system.

The master branch is the stable branch. All files on the master branch are intended to work properly. Development are performed on branches different from the master, and are divided by functionality (eg: If adding a capture module loading a file from disk, this development is performed on a branch called, capture_load_file). After and only when a feature is stable, it may be merge into the master branch.

Name conventions are not stablish yet, however the selected name must show a explicit description of its use.

To compile this project execute the make command.
